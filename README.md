Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This app was made to track inventory for the user.
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
To keep users in mind, I made the UI bright and nice to look at. I also aligned the buttons and the textboxes for a more unified look.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I made a mock-up of the UI and layout before starting to design them. I also took time to create a flowchart for the application code.
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I used Android Studio to test the app. This is important so that the app is running correctly before it is published.
Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Since I have never made an app before, I had a challenge getting started but I used online gudies to help me when I was lost.
In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think the UI layout and design was particulary successful.
